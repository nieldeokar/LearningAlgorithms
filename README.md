# Learning Algorithms

I recently started learning more about Algorithms. I was starting from scratch so though of making this repo to add the basic
alorithm code samples. I hope along with the code sample I would be able to add my own notes to this repo. :D 


### Search 

There are two types of search one is simple and another is binary. Suppose we want to find a guy named Eric in class of 200 students. Simple search would be like asking everyone in the class wheather he is Eric or not. where as Binary search would be 
more like sorting and then searching. Sorting as in since we know that Eric is a male we will only consider males students in class it's just an example

#### Simple Search :
It is like linear search, iterating through each and every element. So worst time to search would be total number of elements.

#### Binary search : 
It is like sorting and elemnating possibilities.
